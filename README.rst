Introduction
============

The ENCODE RNA-Seq pipeline development group was curious
as to whether or not the Caltech generated Illlumina spike-in sequences
would conflict with the newer NIST generated spikes.

The makefile is designed to build the bowtie 1 and 2 indexes
and several fixed width sliding window views of the spike-in files.

The analysis is being done in the ipython notebook `spike-evaluation.ipynb`_
